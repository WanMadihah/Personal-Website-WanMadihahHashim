		<p><h1>ABOUT ME</h1></p>
		<p><b>Hello Friends,<b/>
		Welcome to <b>My Personal Website.</b> <br>
		My name is Wan Madihah Binti Hashim and I'm 22 years old this year. Most of my friends call me Madi but my families call me “Kakak”. I was born on 26th October 1999 at Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II Kota Bharu, Kelantan. I have 8 siblings including me, 3 sisters and 5 brothers. As you all might guess, I'm the oldest sister in the family. I live in Kampung Sokor, Kok Lanas Kelantan. <br>
		</p>
		<p>My hobby is seeking for a new experience and dives into a great adventure. Although I don’t get to travel much, I relish every moment I get to. I am generally pleased with my life. But as for now, I do really love hiking and admires the natures around me. I also love sports and my favorites sports are table tennis, futsal, canoeing and badminton. I am an easy going person and I love my life. </p>
		<p>In the future, I wish to be a teacher in Physical Education or even a fitness trainer. Even though I am currently studied in Bachelor of Business studies in Finance, I don’t think that I can’t pursued my dream to be a teacher in Physical Education as I believe in myself and also I have faith that Allah SWT is The Great Planner and anything can happens on His wills. In Shaa Allah. </p>

	<div class="experience">
		<p><h1>MY BEST EXPERIENCES IN LIFE</h1></p>
		<p>As a 22 years old girl, I do face many cool and great experiences in my life. But I also had faced many failures in order to be successful. I had joined the “Kor-Sukarelawan Polis Siswa” (SUKSIS) while I studied my Diploma in Accountancy in 2017 and had graduate as Inspector KS Wan Madihah in 2019. It is the best experience for me because I had learned so much while in the training for two and half years. I am now more disciplined and mentally strong to face challenges in the future.<br>
		</p>
		<p>I am also having great experiences in sports activities like Futsal, Canoeing, Badminton and Hiking. I have gained a lot of new friends because of it and I am never regret of being an athlete. Being an athlete totally change my life. I am more friendly, care about sportsmanship and the most important things is that, I am become more independent and discipline towards myself.</p>

	<p>“A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.”</p>
	<p><h2>Some people have “photographic” faces – faces that attract everybody’s attention – but I don’t.  So, choosing a favorites photograph of mine, with me in it, is indeed a challenge for me. But, I do love to take photos of nature and something around me. I am not sure exactly how many pictures   were taken, but I would assume, it must have been quite a few and this is some of my favorite’s photos.</h2></p>
